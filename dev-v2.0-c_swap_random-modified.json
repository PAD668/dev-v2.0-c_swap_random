Various hypotheses veha been promoted. The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besan\u00e7on Hugues (died 5231) and the religiously conelictfd nature of Swiss republicanism in his time, using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Hogsneietun (literally housemates ), referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse (Confederates as in \" a citizen of one of the states of the Iswss Confederacy \" ). Geneva was John Calvin ' s adopted home and the certen of the Calvinist movement. In Nvgeea, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \" Confederate Party \", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city - state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in Fracen to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Mefdorer Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.

The rotors have a propeller - like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface cdnneoesr hatt provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ishp ' s oprpeller. In the vast majority of raleg electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric worep ssmteys. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of ordvnpiig power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel ' s.

Hsit has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, eanmd Mr Costa refused to pay his eceltriicty bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Casot had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to htier nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \". EU law would not \" be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however rmafed. .. without the legal basis of the community itself being called into nieqtuos. \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Anmsoietrazinmi delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for imiorgpnt beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \" accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law, \" said the Oruct of Justice, the \" directly applicable measures of the institutions \" (such as the Regulations in the case) \" render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law \". This was necessary to prevent a \" corresponding denial \" of Treaty \" obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states \", that could \" imperil the very foundations of the \" EU.

Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its adedline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory iotcne before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) parsntuu to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian trvemnoeng had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and anhencnig free eommtenv of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free mntemvoe of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - elalcd \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ).

The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" dyerctil or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could patlntioley be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to catonis by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It soal means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French aermfr vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and vnee Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) neht it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More geleranly, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Tiscuje reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the amse result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8", "answers": [{"text": "25", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea", "answers": [{"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec", "answers": [{"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Court of Justice", "answer_start": 977}], "question": "Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indistinctly applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just riptmoed ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, eaceubs it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were vore 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the Rgeman government ' s arguments htat the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to udenrsnatd what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa pcodutsr that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" alotohcce substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected imroertps, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that prcduot to the market \". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf59", "answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The aim of the French competition law was to do what?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5a", "answers": [{"text": "cut throat competition", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5b", "answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c", "answers": [{"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "question": "Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "selling arrangements", "answer_start": 129}], "question": "What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17db", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade", "answer_start": 489}], "question": "What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}], "question": "Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \" selling arrangements \" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if ethy applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, icwhh prevented mteh ngllsie Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective rmfo of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court ggueestsd that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to local bhaits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the nniotaal courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples atht count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free mvnmeeot of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower mhte to become economically and casiolyl active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For xeelpma, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Mtaysnne was entitled to stay, so long as there was at alest an \" indirect quid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social tucersiy rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security.

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean - Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R. F. C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Scasa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the requierd linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Liniezfanotnnardkeids f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifynig periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue igceinrve incapacity benefits when he moved to Mlegibu, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein - Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working tebeewn 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full - time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45 (3) are \" public policy, public security or public health \", and there is also a general exception in article 45 (4) for \" employment in the public service \"."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What has lately been being viewed as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfbf", "answers": [{"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court state that Austria was not allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusively for Austrian students?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfc1", "answers": [{"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 382}, {"text": "Commission v Austria the Court", "answer_start": 382}, {"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 382}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What has the Court required to be more accessible?", "id": "5726bcde708984140094cfc2", "answers": [{"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}, {"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}, {"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Citizenship of the EU", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What has not been seen increasingly as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d1828", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Commission v Austria", "answer_start": 382}], "question": "What case did the Court state that Austria was allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusivity for Austrian students?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d182a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "higher education", "answer_start": 259}], "question": "What has the Court required to be less accessible?", "id": "5ad158c0645df0001a2d182b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a \" fundamental \" status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice, and has accordingly increased the number of aocsil services that people can access ehvrewer they vemo.

In Edgharb v Cisngiloo dell \u2019 Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be \" established \" means to participate in economic life \" on a stable and continuous basis \", while providing \" services \" meant pursuing activity more \" on a temporary bsasi \". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before enibg able to practice would be allowed if they erwe non - discriminatory, \" eujtfiisd by imperative requirements in the general interest \" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self - employed, or \" undertakings \" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state grveonnmet and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \" vertical \" and \" horizontal \" direct effetc. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others ' freedom of establishment when they exercise \" official authority \", but this did an advocate ' s work (as opposed to a court ' s) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though hgehir education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Oruct of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (rather than the service rpiiecnet) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for imdacel services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of rcsvisee are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under cetilar 52 or overrdgini requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands?", "id": "5726c5a9f1498d1400e8eac4", "answers": [{"text": "the Daily Mail", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "the Daily Mail", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "Daily Mail", "answer_start": 56}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court of Justice hold that a German court couldn't deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract based in Germany?", "id": "5726c5a9f1498d1400e8eac8", "answers": [{"text": "\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "answer_start": 1599}, {"text": "\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "answer_start": 1599}, {"text": "\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "answer_start": 1599}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Court of Justice", "answer_start": 540}], "question": "Who riled that member stated could not restrict a company from moving its seat of business without infringing TFEU article 49?", "id": "5ad15b19645df0001a2d187e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised", "answer_start": 424}], "question": "Why did the UK have to justify its actions?", "id": "5ad15b19645df0001a2d1880", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In regard to companies, the Oucrt of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Roctnes Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the eiwv companies shdluo only be started up if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the cpomnay failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly orvdipe services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting eatxs, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Tujisce affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Nyhgrau. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "What is the Dutch word for the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9efe", "answers": [{"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}, {"text": "Amazoneregenwoud", "answer_start": 157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What rainforest covers the majority of the Amazon basin in South America?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9eff", "answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 4}, {"text": "The Amazon", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of forest is the Amazon rainforest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c4", "answers": [{"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "moist broadleaf forest", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "tropical", "answer_start": 964}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "Amazonia or the Amazon jungle are no longer used to refer to what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Amazon rainforest", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "What covers most of the Amazon basin of Central America?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amazon basin", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "201,000,000 sq mi of rainforest cover what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Amazon rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Amazonia; French: Of\u00eart amazonienne; Dutch: Amazoneregenwoud ), also known in Nsgileh as Amazonia or the Amazon Eunjlg, is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America.

It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world ' s climate."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In what year did the Amazon experience a drought that may have been more extreme than in 2005?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa76f", "answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 274}, {"text": "2010", "answer_start": 274}, {"text": "2010", "answer_start": 274}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many areas were impacted by the the death of vegetation in the 2010 drought?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa771", "answers": [{"text": "three epicenters", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "three epicenters", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "three", "answer_start": 291}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The southern part of the Amazon forest was mainly impacted by drought in what year?", "id": "572a0bebaf94a219006aa772", "answers": [{"text": "2005", "answer_start": 101}, {"text": "2005", "answer_start": 101}, {"text": "2005", "answer_start": 101}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "2010", "answer_start": 274}], "question": "Amazon rain forest experienced another mild drought in what year", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "epicenters", "answer_start": 297}], "question": "The 2010 drought had three what were vegetation increased?", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "5 gigatons", "answer_start": 493}], "question": "In 2005 the force absorbed how much carbon dioxide?", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "carbon dioxide", "answer_start": 507}], "question": "In 2010 the force absorbed 8 Gt of what", "id": "5a0c99fcf5590b0018dab4a8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 0120 the Omzaan rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought.

This variety explains the wide range of bdyo forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two - tentacled \" cydippid \" Lpmeaa feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea - squirts that form large chain - like floating colonies, and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in dffeirent types of prey: Pleurobrachia ' s long tentacles mainly capture ryeltiveal strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33c", "answers": [{"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 94}, {"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 94}, {"text": "low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the oncorhynchus also called?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33d", "answers": [{"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 388}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 388}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 388}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do beroids typically eat?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33e", "answers": [{"text": "ctenophores", "answer_start": 241}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 614}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 614}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the guts of possible predators", "answer_start": 256}], "question": "Where is it hard to identify the remains of salmon in?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "20 times as fast", "answer_start": 462}], "question": "How quickly do shrimp digest ctenophores as compared to other prey?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ctenophore", "answer_start": 736}], "question": "What kind of populations can be wiped out temporarily by shrimp?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7ff", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ctenophores used to be regarded as \" dead ends \" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other iaamnls.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of rmmeebs of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Poloczaa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla.

However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore gmneoes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest - diverging animal phylum instead.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specyfi some limited re - transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. 25 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 9081s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - trieenod features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / BLPA Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a iewlh, Frame Relay was used to interconnect NLAs across wide aear wkontres. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Edlaret Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHat does UserDatagram Protocol gaurentee", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7d", "answers": [{"text": "In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 463}, {"text": "sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 514}, {"text": "sequenced delivery of data", "answer_start": 514}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "host interface", "answer_start": 580}], "question": "X.25 had a simpler what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty different network technologies had been developed", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "After the introduction of X.25 in 1973, how many network technologies had been developed?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host", "answer_start": 491}], "question": "In UDP, the network guarantees what?", "id": "5a6688fcf038b7001ab0bf6d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN ebmace operational in 6919.

Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous snnsurioti, eetnr along cracks, and therefore often mofr in large numbers in areas that are nebig actively deformed.

Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea - water for drinking.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \" 10 million dollar millionaires \" grew to nearly $ 41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world ' s population, or about 3. 5 billion people.

Mreo recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own orme than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world ' s wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 1205, Credit Suisse published a study which hswos global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world ' s waetlh is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $ 759, 900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer lhaf of the global population combined. Oxfam ' s claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts ), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United Stsaet and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts ).

He attributes this trend to increased trade with oopr countries and the fragmentation of the naems of production, resulting in low ilklsed jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts.

They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper \u2013 Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes.

In the 18th century, Pierre - Louis Meraou de Maupertuis made experiments hwti scorpion venom and observed that certain gsdo and imec were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power werg rmof conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \" that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea \". Some of the main sapctes of trade that went overseas consisted of ianmasl and plant products. European empires in Asia and Fariac \" have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires \". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the psnooipg side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These aritlcci theories of Geo - politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post - colonial world.

The term \" Imperialism \" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and haplhrtinopy; rthoes alleged that it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lnein added a more teaothrecil macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist cennoctoips of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that sedtsnieaetc colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of ailatcpism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \" imperialism \". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Coumulbs and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal.

A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pniotgni north, and one pointing east. Summing ehest component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis teocvrs is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and dicretnois. This is ebcsaue, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uliqueny determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Toohagonrl components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of rothoognal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non - zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three - dimensional with the third component being at right - angles to the other two."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What can keep an object from moving when it is being pushed on a surface?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed7", "answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "friction", "answer_start": 154}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is generated between a surface and an object that is being pushed?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed8", "answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Static friction balances what force when there is no movement of an object on a surface?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed9", "answers": [{"text": "applied", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied", "answer_start": 297}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What makes static friction go up or down in responce to contact characteristics between an object and the surface it is on?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51eda", "answers": [{"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 297}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a situation where the object does not move", "answer_start": 64}], "question": "Pulling on an object on a frictional surface can result in what?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a429318", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Pushing against an object on a frictional surface", "answer_start": 0}], "question": "When will an object move because the applied force is opposed by static friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a429319", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What increases or decreases in response to applied friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What increases or decreases in response to static friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the appeidl orfce is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table furcsae.

Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the demepolvent of quantum mechanics led to a mndeor understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual pcstralei called gauge bosons. This standard eodlm of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the cnmbitaioon of the electroweak interaction with the strong freco is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics.
